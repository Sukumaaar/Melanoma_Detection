# Skin Cancer Prediction
The aim of this project is to develop a CNN-based model that can accurately detect melanoma, a type of skin cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. Melanoma accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths, and a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
The project involves using a dataset of skin cancer images consisting of 9 sub-directories within the train and test directories, with each sub-directory containing images of a specific type of skin cancer. The goal of the project is to accurately predict skin cancer of all 9 classes, which can help in timely diagnosis of the following diseases:
*Actinic keratosis
*Basal cell carcinoma
*Dermatofibroma
*Melanoma
*Nevus
*Pigmented benign keratosis
*Seborrheic keratosis
*Squamous cell carcinoma
*Vascular lesion

## Conclusions
The model 3 was able to predict skin cancer of all 9 classes with a reported training accuracy and validation accuracy.
